err-dnsutils
============

Run common DNS utils from Err: host, dig, nslookup

### Installation

You can install err-dnsutils directly from err using:

	!repos install err-dnsutils

	Alternatively, you can also clone this repository into your BOT\_EXTRA\_PLUGIN\_DIR and restart your bot to load the new plugin.

### Configuration

This plugin requires no configuration at this time

### Dependencies

No extra python dependencies are required, however you do need to have host, dig and nslookup installed on your system.

Most Linux distributions have these packaged together as dnsutils. On Gentoo the package you need is called net-dns/bind-tools
